## 📝 TALKING POINTS SCRIPT

### Introduction
"Welcome to the Creator Studio walkthrough. I'm going to show you the complete process of creating a game template from scratch, running validation tests, and publishing it to the marketplace. By the end of this video, you'll know how to create professional CBE games that brands can customize and deploy."

### During Form Filling
"The template form guides the AI in generating your game. Be specific about your scenario, industry, and edge cases. The more detail you provide, the better the generated game will match your vision."

### During Testing
"V3.1 introduces 8 automated validation checks. These ensure your game meets the PlayOps Framework standards, works on mobile devices, includes proper scoring, and emits telemetry correctly. Every template must pass all 8 checks before publishing."

### During Publishing
"Publishing creates two game modes automatically. Training mode lets players practice without pressure. Testing mode includes scoring, proficiency levels, and proof emission for tracking progress. Brands get both modes when they customize your template."

### Closing
"That's the complete creator flow. You can build as many templates as you want, upload reusable design assets, and track performance in real-time. The marketplace connects you with brands looking for quality CBE games. Start creating today!"
